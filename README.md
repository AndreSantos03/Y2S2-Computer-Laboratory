![Main Menu](image.png)

Word Guesser is based on the famous Wordle(https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game.
To keep it simple in this game you have to guess a word. As you keep guessing some letters might have different background colors.
Red means that that letter doesn't belong to the word, if it is yellow it means that the letter belongs to the word, but it's on the wrong place, if it is green it means the letters it's on the right spot.

The player wins if he gets the word under 5 tries.

##The game contains 2 gamemodes!
The first is "Daily word". Here there will be a word that will change each day.
The other one is "Random word". Where the user can choose the length of the word to guess and the word will change as you keep playing.
